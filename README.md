# Temperature Converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)

This is a simple Python program created for **absolute beginners**.
It helps learners understand how basic logic works by converting
temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## 🌱 Beginner Friendly Project
This project is specially designed for learners who:
- Are new to Python
- Want to practice input and output
- Are learning if-else conditions
- Want to build confidence with small programs

## 📌 What This Program Can Do
- Convert Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit
- Convert Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius
- Ask user for input and show correct output

## 🧠 Python Concepts Covered
- `print()` for displaying messages
- `input()` for taking user input
- `int()` and `float()` type conversion
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions
- Basic mathematical formulas

## 🧮 Temperature Conversion Logic
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**  
  `(C × 9/5) + 32`

- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**  
  `(F − 32) × 5/9`

## 🎓 Learning Outcome
After understanding this program, a beginner will be able to:
- Take user input confidently
- Use conditional statements correctly
- Apply real-life formulas in Python
- Build small logic-based programs

## 🚀 Ideas to Improve This Project
(Beginner practice ideas)
- Add a loop to repeat the program
- Add input validation
- Convert the code into functions
- Create a menu-driven version
